## 📊 Introduction

This project, *PATHALAM*, is inspired by a statistical dataset covering 5 years of pothole-related accidents in Kottakkal, Kerala. The report reflects estimated numbers of accidents, injuries, and fatalities, offering a localized view of a statewide issue.

---

## 💡 Project Idea

**PATHALAM** is a real-time **Pothole Detection and Warning System** that leverages smartphone sensors and GPS to identify potholes, alert nearby users, and notify authorities automatically.

> Our mission is to reduce road accidents, improve travel safety, and assist in better urban planning through community-driven insights.

## 🚀 Core Functionalities

* **📱 Sensor-Based Detection**
  Uses smartphone accelerometers to detect abnormal bumps or vibrations.

* **📍 GPS Location Recording**
  Captures precise coordinates of detected potholes.

* **🔔 Real-Time Warnings**
  Shares alerts instantly with users on the same or nearby routes.

* **🛑 Accident Prevention**
  Enables proactive action by drivers and pedestrians.

* **🗺️ Crowd-sourced Pothole Map**
  Aggregates user data into a live, interactive pothole map.

* **📢 Automated Authority Alerts**
  If repeated pothole signals persist for 5+ seconds, an alert is auto-sent to the designated road authority for action.

---

## 📌 Why "5 Seconds"?

If continuous shaking is detected for more than 5 seconds, it likely indicates a severe or dangerous pothole. This helps:

* Reduce false positives
* Prioritize critical areas
* Trigger automatic emergency or authority alerts

---

## 🗺️ Map-Based Pothole Insights

Our system displays pothole hotspots with real-time data overlays.

### Insights Derived:

1. **Traffic Density Indicator**
   More warnings = Heavier traffic = Suggest alternate routes

2. **Road Safety Analysis**
   Frequent alerts in a region signal poor road conditions and can inform users and road maintenance bodies.

## 🏁 Outcomes

* ✅ Safer roads
* ✅ Reduced traffic in poor-condition areas
* ✅ Lower road wear and tear
* ✅ Better urban planning and policy-making
* ✅ Emergency preparedness
